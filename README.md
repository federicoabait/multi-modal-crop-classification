* Code information:

Each folder has been named based on experiment type.  


1. To run training/gridsearch cd to each folder and do:
 
> ```python3 train_gridsearch.py --config '.config file name' --task 'task name'```


for each combination of parameters specified in train_gridsearch.py, train_gridsearch.py generates model as per specifications and saves it to disk.

2. the models are given names based on timestamp when they started training. This gives us easy way to check which hyperparameters in grid gave best result and choose that for prediction. 

3. To change configuration parameters update them in config.ini

4. To evalulate a particular model, specify the network name as shown below, 
> ``` python3 predict_multi.py --config 'config file name' --task 'task name'```


The best generated model names are hard coded in the first few lines of predict_multi.py. Once you run your train_gridsearch.py, use the model name generated by train.py and change the first few lines in predict_multi.py

5. To generate plots of your loss etc use functions defined in visualize.py function
