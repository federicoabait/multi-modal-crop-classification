## Summary
Using SVM to predict output on combination of spatial and temporal streams 


## How to run the code:


1. Run this after you finish running ```predict_for_fusion.py``` in ```purely_spatial``` and ```lstm``` folders. Copy the csv files generated by that method into this folder.

2. To run training/gridsearch cd to each folder and do:
 
 ```python3 train_and_predict.py```
